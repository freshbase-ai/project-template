# Specs

Technical specifications for features and components.

## Structure

Each spec is a markdown file following the `spec.md` template:

- `user-management-spec.md`
- `payment-integration-spec.md`

## Template

Use the `.freshbase/templates/spec.md` template for new specifications:

```bash
cp .freshbase/templates/spec.md specs/new-spec.md
```

## Guidelines

- Reference related problems from `discovery/problems/`
- Include user stories and acceptance criteria
- Define functional and non-functional requirements
- Link to related ADRs and contexts
