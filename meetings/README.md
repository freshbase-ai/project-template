# Meetings

Meeting transcriptions and notes.

## Structure

Each meeting is a markdown file following the `meeting.md` template:

- `2024-01-15-kickoff.md`
- `2024-01-20-sprint-planning.md`

## Template

Use the `.freshbase/templates/meeting.md` template for new meetings:

```bash
cp .freshbase/templates/meeting.md meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
```

## Guidelines

- Use date prefix for chronological ordering
- Include participants and duration
- Extract action items with owners
- Link to related specs or decisions created from the meeting
