# Cross-Cutting

Features and concerns that span multiple contexts.

## Examples

- Authentication & Authorization
- Logging & Monitoring
- Error Handling
- Internationalization

## Guidelines

- Document features that don't belong to a single context
- Use `context-map.md` template for multi-context features
- Link to affected contexts
