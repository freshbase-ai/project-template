# Discovery

Business layer for early-stage exploration and validation.

## Structure

```
discovery/
├── problems/      # Business problems to solve
├── hypotheses/    # Hypotheses to validate
└── meetings/      # Meeting notes (alternative location)
```

## Templates

- `.freshbase/templates/problem.md` - For problem statements
- `.freshbase/templates/hypothesis.md` - For hypotheses

## Guidelines

- Start with problems, then hypotheses
- Validate hypotheses before creating specs
- Link problems to specs and contexts they drive
